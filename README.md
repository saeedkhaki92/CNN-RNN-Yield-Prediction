# CNN-RNN-Yield-Prediction



This repository contains codes for the paper entitled "A CNN-RNN Framework for Crop Yield Prediction". The paper was authored by Saeed Khaki, Lizhi Wang, and Sotirios Archontoulis. In this paper, we proposed a framework for crop yield prediction.

## Dimension of Input Data

Let nw, ns, np, nss be the number of weather components, soil component meaured at different depth, planting time component, and soil component meaured at the surface. Let m be the total number of observations. So `X`
